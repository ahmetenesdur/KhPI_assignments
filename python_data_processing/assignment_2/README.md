# Laboratory Work 2: Using Pandas for Data Analysis

## Goal

Learning main Pandas features for data analysis.

## Assignment

1. Download US Baby Names dataset from the site kaggle.com ([Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names?select=NationalNames.csv))
2. Do exercises according to individual task. For calculating the number of individual task, use the formula `N = ord("A") % 5 + 1`, where `N` is number of individual task, `A` is the first letter of your name. Individual task Exercises for Variant 1 are listed below.

### Variant 1 Exercises
1. Output the first 8 rows of the dataset
2. Output the last 8 rows of the dataset
3. Get the names of dataset columns
4. Get general information about data in the dataset
5. Find the number of unique names in whole dataset
6. Calculate the number of unique female and male names in whole dataset
7. Find 5 the most popular male names in 2010
8. Find the most popular name based on the results of one year (the name for which Count is maximum)
9. Count the number of records with Count = minimum.
10. Count the number of unique names in each year
11. Find the year with the most number of unique names.
12. Find most popular name of the year with the most number of unique names (that is in 2008)
13. Find the year when the name “Jacob” was the most popular as a female name
14. Find year, with the most number of gender neutral names (the same male and female names)
15. Find total births per year
16. Find the year when the greatest number of children was born
17. Find the number of girls and boys that were born in each year
18. Count the number of years when more girls were born than boys
19. Draw the plot of total births per year of boys and girls
20. Count number of gender neutral names (same for girls and boys)
21. Count how much times boys were named as Barbara
22. Calculate how many years the observation was carried out
23. Find the most popular gender neutral names (those present each year)
24. Find the most popular unpopular names (unpopular name that babies have been called the most times)
25. Plot graphs of the distribution of the number of names “John” and “Mary” by years, regardless of gender.
26. Plot graphs of the distribution of the number of female names “John” and male names “Mary” by years
27. Find the most popular names each year

## Lab 2 Report: Analysis of US Baby Names (1880 - 2014)


## Topic and Goal of the Lab
The goal of this lab is to understand the fundamental features of the Pandas library for data analysis by working on a real dataset - the US Baby Names dataset from Kaggle. The exercises aim to explore various aspects of the dataset such as the distribution of names, gender-neutral names, and trend analysis over the years.

## Progress of the Work
The exercises were executed sequentially as outlined in the laboratory assignment. The Pandas library was utilized extensively to manipulate and analyze the dataset. Key tasks included calculating unique names, identifying gender-neutral names, and visualizing trends over the years.
