# Laboratory Work No. 3 - Using Forms, POST Method, and Bootstrap

## Introduction

This laboratory work aims to enhance the web application developed in the previous labs by integrating HTML forms, validating user input, and employing Bootstrap to improve the UI/UX. The tasks include setting parameters using HTML forms elements, performing data validation to prevent empty input submission, using Bootstrap for styling, and creating a new page for choosing the calculation direction.

### Conclusions

In this lab, I have expanded my understanding of creating interactive web applications using Flask. I learned how to design HTML forms, handle POST requests, validate form data, and improve the user interface with Bootstrap. The lab exercise enriched my comprehension of the client-server model, particularly how data is transferred from the client to the server and how to process this data to generate meaningful output.
